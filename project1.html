    <h3>summary</h3>
    <p> With a plethora of cloud storage platforms being all viable options for users, Flowspace means to enter the space to create a more transparent cloud storage platform where users have full control over the security of their files while maintaining the simplicity they crave. I researched, branded, designed and prototyped Flowspace for my Bloc Designer Track project.</p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>Most cloud storage platforms are not as focused on privacy and security as they should be. The majority are more focused on being a place that you can house your files, sharing those files and collaborating on documents. Some have options for security, but these can only be unlocked with further payments which include features the user may not even need, but are forced to pay for in order to feel secure.</p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>With an emphasis on transparency and control for users, Flowspace allows users to not only do the basics of what is needed in a cloud storage app, such as uploading and saving files, sharing, collaborating, and creating documents, but also offers full control and transparency over the files they have shared on an indiviudal level. All of these features are included in the free version, so users will only need to purchase a plan in order to have more storage space, but with a generous 10GB of free storage offered from the beginning, users will be enticed to join.</p>

          <p>Entering flow is when  the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.</p>
          <p>The idea is to melt this concept into a cloud storage service where all of your important files are in one place and are easily organizable to make sure you have everything you need to collaborate, share, and create in either a personal or professional manner.</p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Logo Sketches & Concepts</h3>
            <img src="images/logosketches.svg" alt="logo sketches">
          <p>I drew up some images that made me think of the word ‘flow’, and eventually came up with this sort of melting down an icon concept.</p>
          <p>Once this was drawn out and the feeling that I wanted Flowspace to evoke was chosen, I got to work choosing a color palette that I thought would help express those emotions further.</p>
          <p>I had originally wanted to use a very minimalistic look when it came to the logo, starting with this black and white version, but seeing it in digital form, I decided it needed a bit more.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Style Guide</h3>
          <p>I chose to use the darker blue as a brand color because it symbolizes intelligence and trust while the lighter coral and aqua give an inviting, friendly vibe. The coral color is a pop of color that is fun and energetic, like entering a “flow state” can be. I believe the fonts are soft and playful which add to this effect. I chose to use the same fonts together instead of the previous ‘basic’ font as the brand font because once I tried it out, they seemed to mesh well together and look different enough when changing weight and size, although they are technically the same.</p>

    <h3 class="subtitle"> Breaking down the problem</h3>
    <p>The process of creating Flowspace taught me a lot about not only the design process, but also myself as a designer. This project was difficult as it does seem that cloud storage apps are ingrained in many users lives already. I struggled to try and differentiate Flowspace from the pack of most used cloud storage apps out there while still maintaining some similarities so as not to confuse users from a process they are comfortable using. Through the competitive analysis, the main weakness I noticed was that many of the security functions that are offered by other apps are only available in paid versions. Flowspace has something on the competition by offering all of the features in the free version and only up-charging for more storage space.</p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Stepping out of my comfort zone</h3>
    <p>In the beginning stages of the project, what surprised me the most was having a vision for the project that changed drastically when the branding began. I originally wanted Flowspace to be very minimal in aesthetic, and what came out of the style guide and logo was a far more bubbly and whimsical vibe, which I think works really well with the name, the final logo, and the color pallette. By having an idea before I had even branded the project, I placed myself into a box which I found slowed down the design process quite a bit.<br>Creating Flowspace was an extremely important learning experience as I now have a full view of a project from start to finish and can see how I would save more time and was able to really expand on who I thought I was as a designer before in terms of style. </p>
